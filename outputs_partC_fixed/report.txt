Final Test Accuracy: 89.92%
Model parameters: hidden_dim=256, num_heads=6, patch_size=10

Observations:
- The corrected architecture restores full performance (~90% accuracy).
- Attention heads highlight multiple regions of clothing distinctly.
- Patch size 10 balances feature granularity and computational cost.
- Accuracy curve shows smooth convergence, indicating stable training.
- Confusion matrix confirms consistent class discrimination.
